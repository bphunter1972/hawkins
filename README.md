Layering Protocols With Chained Sequencers
==========================================

This repository exists to provide working code that demonstrates the concept of chained sequencers, as presented in the textbook Advanced UVM and in the SNUG 2016 Silicon Valley paper entitled "Layering Protocols With Chained Sequencers."

This repository also demonstrates the coding guidelines presented within Advanced UVM and many of the other techniques described in that book.

Because additional changes were made while authoring the SNUG 2016 paper, the current version of this code differs substantially from Chapter 5 of Advanced UVM, 1st edition. For this I deeply apologize. However, people who have already purchased the textbook should be aware that your purchase through Amazon also provides you with FREE access to the Kindle e-book version. The ebook version will be updated to reflect the numerous changes once the paper has been accepted at SNUG.

If you have not yet purchased Advanced UVM, what are you waiting for?!?
